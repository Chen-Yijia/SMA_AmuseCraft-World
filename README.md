# AmuseCraft World

Welcome to the **AmuseCraft World: Your Park, Your Rules**!
Begin the adventure to design your first amusement park.

The simulation is deployed at [https://chen-yijia.github.io/SMAtest/](https://chen-yijia.github.io/SMAtest/)
However, since the 3D models take a bit long to load so give it more patience!

Alternatively, for seamless interaction with the simulation, we recommend opening the code repository in Visual Studio Code and installing the "[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)" extension. Once installed, navigate to the 'index.html' file in the file explorer, right-click, and select 'Open with Live Server'. This will open a new browser tab where you can enjoy the simulation seamlessly with faster loading times!
